## The Process
1. Tracked data on fitbit for 3 days with social media
2. Tracked data on fitbit for 2 days without social media
3. Analyzed data in pandas
4. Created data plots
  * Struggled with with using Apple's Numbers application and editing my fitbit data so time plots for sleep tracking did not work because I couldn't figure out how to make headings on numbers for my data in the csv file
5. Website mock-up

## The Challenges
1. Finding the right file paths for all of my csv files was difficult since I had to recreate so many of my files in numbers because of data issues.
2. After doing this project, I have learned that it is incredibly necessary for me to buy excel for continuing my work on my project into an independent study next year. Numbers was by far one of the hardest parts of downloading and exporting my fitbit data since the program did not download the files correctly and adjusted my table so it would not have headers in pandas and making pandas unable to organize the data no matter how many different strings of code I tried.

## The Goal
>The goal of this project was to analyze data from a teenager using and not using social media to see the effect it has on our mental and physical well-beings. I wasn't shocked by the results as I was expecting to see some interesting things, but when I went without social media and saw the results it had for me, I was impressed and saddened by the fact that this is what our society has turned into. Yet being able to show these results and display the impact it has on the well-being of our youth, I am so excited to continue diving deeper into my project next year!
